Here's [my PGP key](/theme/files/pcode.asc). Keep it close somewhere for more secure connections in future. You can also download it from [pgp.mit.edu](http://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xAF5A5A4AD4FD8797).

And the fingerprint:

```text
pub   rsa4096 2020-01-26 [SC]
      8CC7 EB15 3563 4205 E9C2  AAD9 AF5A 5A4A D4FD 8797
```

The email I used to create this PGP key, the same as my protonmail account, but the key is different. I've created it inside my own computer.
I trust Protonmail, but not more than myself.
