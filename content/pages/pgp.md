Here's [my PGP key](/theme/files/pouya.gpg.asc). Keep it close somewhere for more secure connections in future. You can also download it from [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=8CC7EB1535634205E9C2AAD9AF5A5A4AD4FD8797).

And the fingerprint:

```text
rsa4096/0xAF5A5A4AD4FD8797 2020-01-26
8CC7 EB15 3563 4205 E9C2  AAD9 AF5A 5A4A D4FD 8797
```

You can also search my emails in [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org). Since they use email verification, it's pretty safe to lookup keys by their associated email.
