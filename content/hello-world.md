## The first blog post
If you want me to name one thing that's more difficult than programming, I'd say writing a blog post. Over the past few years, I built and rebuilt this blog many times using many blogging systems, crafting it for perfection, but not even once I could write a decent article in it.

Maybe it's the fear of blank page, maybe I'm afraid I write an article and a couple of months later I become a new person with new perspective, maybe my urge towards perfection keeps me from writing "something" before making it "absolute perfect".

Anyway, enough is enough, I just decided to face my fear and go for it.


## About the blog
I used [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to generate this website and you can see FontAwesome icons here and there; as you guessed already, favicon is "nerd-face" from Twemoji!

My current avatar the is a slightly edited version of [lpxpcs](https://mega.nz/#F!mXgW3apI!Tdikb01SoOaTmNLiaTRhMg)'s penguin they used in their beautiful designs.
I used [ProggyTiny](https://proggyfonts.net/download/) font to create my logo, I absolutely love their work. It's an amazing, clear, pixel-perfect font to fill your terminal emulator with text. It's clearly readable on small size.

For other texts on this blog, you can see QuickSand, Roboto and ubuntu-mono, three eye-pleasing fonts, designed by talented people.


## Where to find me
I'm not currently active on any social media, I don't really like them much. You might want to see some of my codes on  Gitlab, DevHeroes.club is the Q&A forum I love, and you can always find my favorite books on my GoodReads account. All linked on menu-bar, feel free to check them out.


## Bottom line
If you read this, please let me know what you think. This is a static website and I don't want to use third-party commenting system, mostly for privacy reasons. So if you're interested, please send me an email and let me know what you think about my blog.

I'm a geek, currently busy writing codes. So you already know what my blogs would be about. If you find anything incorrect or misleading, please leave me an email and let me know.
