## The first blog post
If you want me to name one thing that's more difficult than programming, I'd say writing a blog post. Over the past few years, I built and rebuilt this blog many times using many blogging systems, crafting it for perfection, but not even once I could write a decent article in it.

Maybe it's the fear of blank page, maybe I'm afraid I write an article and a couple of months later I become a new person with new perspective, maybe my urge towards perfection keeps me from writing "something" before making it "absolute perfect".

Anyway, enough is enough, I just decided to face my fear and go for it.


## About the blog
I used [pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/) to generate this website and [bulma](https://bulma.io) gave it life, you can see [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons here and there and as you guessed already, favicon is `nerd-face` from [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji). 


## Bottom line
If you read this, please let me know what you think. This is a static website and I don't want to use third-party commenting system, mostly for privacy reasons. So if you're interested, please send me an email and let me know what you think about my blog.

I'm a geek, currently busy writing codes. So you already know what my blogs would be about. If you find anything incorrect or missleading, please leave me an email and let me know.
